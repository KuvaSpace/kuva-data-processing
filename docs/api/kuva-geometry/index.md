# Kuva Geometry

The `kuva-geometry` project contains various class definitions and utility functions related 
to imaging and Earth geometry. These help in processing Kuva Space products and to provide 
additional commonly used tools.

Currently, the main use is for calculating the satellite camera rays on the Earth to get 
footprints of the imaged area.
