# Kuva Reader

The reader project allows the reading of Kuva Space products from any part of its processing chain.

The Kuva Space images are in GeoTIFF format. The products consist of an image or multiple 
images along with its metadata to give all the necessary information to use the products. 
The metadata lives either in a Kuva Space database, or alternatively in a sidecar JSON file. 

This library allows the reading of the image GeoTIFFs into `xarray.Dataset` objects that 
allow convenient raster manipulations, along with their `kuva-metadata` metadata objects.

## Processing levels

Currently the reader supports the following processing levels for Kuva products:

- **L0**: Radiometrically corrected frames as TOA radiance
- **L1AB**: Band-aligned product formed from multiple L0 products
- **L1C**: Georeferences and orthorectified L1 product
- **L2A**: Atmospherically corrected product as BOA reflectance

## Special tags

All images generated by Kuva Space should have the following special tags added to the
geotiff metadata.
- `_KUVA_PRODUCT_LEVEL`: A string, e.g, `"0"` describing the level of the product.
- `_KUVA_PRODUCT_ID`: The id on the database for the product associated with the geotiff.

This makes it very easy to pinpoint what product we are dealing with and works around
the issue that our images are not a monolithic entity but rather just folders that can
be messed with.
